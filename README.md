Technology Stack

    1. Python 3.7
    2. Cloud Source Repository
    3. Cloud Build
    4. Docker
    5. Cloud Run
    6. HTML5
    7. Ajax
   
Following is the approach steps:

    i) Using python language build Flask application that calculates the angle between clock handles.
    ii) Using python3 packages like Flask, Request,Render_Template, Jsonify etc and HTML5, AJAX to build interactive front end/web page for accepting user parameters .
    iii) Using GIT create local repository.
    iv) Using Docker to convert Python Flask application into Docker Image

Deployment using GCP developer tools-

    1. Cloud Build to create a CI/CD pipeline for building, deploying.
    2. Cloud Run that is a server-less compute platform that enables above hosted app URL.
    3. Cloud Source Repositories, a private Git repositories hosted on Google Cloud.
