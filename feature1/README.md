#### 3. How will you manage any infrastructure needed? - All GCP services used in the solution are Serverless so infrastruction management is not necessary
#### 4. Delivered as a feature branch in the repo fork - All code is available in the branch 'feature1'
#### 5. Bonus points for a working deployed solution in GCP that you can demo at the "sprint review" (ie interview) - A working prototype has been deployed on GCP
