1. Deployable code base
The code can be run using the command python ClockAngle.py --time
The user should supply time in the format hour:minute , e.g. 03:00 or 00:00 or 15:02


2. Solution deployed to a cloud environment
The can be deployed in a serverless environment: Lambda (AWS) , AzureFucntions (Azure) , CloudFunctions(GCP).

3. How will you deploy this solution (in code or as a todo list if time is limited). i.e. how and where will this run? Details of CI/CD pieplines etc.
TO DO:
  3.1 Create a lambda function and put the code in the editor. Modify the code to get the ‘time’ input as an event from API gateway.
  3.2 Create an API Gateway, which when requested will trigger the lambda function.
  3.3 For CI/CD, AWS Code pipeline can be used or Azure pipelines(In case the solution is on Azure and Azure functions are used instead of lambda)

4. How will you manage any infrastructure needed?
  4.1 Create lambda function
  4.2 Create API gateway to call the lambda function
  4.3 No need to manage any infrastructure.


5. Delivered as a feature branch in the repo fork
Branch 'feature_parul' has been created for the same.

6. Any DevOps/Cicd components that would support this feature in a production setting
  AWS Code pipeline or Azure pipelines
